    <headline>National Weather Service Issues Landslide Advisory for Western Washington</headline>
    <description>...HEAVY RAINFALL WILL GIVE A RISK FOR LANDSLIDES TO WESTERN
WASHINGTON THROUGH TONIGHT..

HEAVY RAINS OF 3 TO 6 INCHES OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS HAVE SATURATED
SOILS AROUND WESTERN WASHINGTON. HEAVY RAINFALL RATES OF 0.25 TO
TO 0.50 INCHES PER HOUR WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE MID AFTERNOON
HOURS. THIS WILL PUT EXTRA PRESSURE ON SOIL STABILITY.

INDICES DEVELOPED BY THE U.S.G.S. SHOW THAT LANDSLIDES ARE POSSIBLE
DURING INTENSE RAINFALL OR WHEN RAINFALL AMOUNTS EXCEED ONE INCH IN
24 HOURS. OBSERVED RAINFALLS HAVE ALREADY EXCEEDED THAT AMOUNT
TODAY...INCLUDING THE SEATTLE AREA.

WHILE THE U.S.G.S. RAINFALL THRESHOLDS APPLY TO THE SEATTLE AREA OF
PUGET SOUND...MOST OF THE LOWLANDS OF WESTERN WASHINGTON ARE
SUSCEPTIBLE TO LANDSLIDES DUE TO WET SOILS. AREAS MOST SUSCEPTIBLE
TO LANDSLIDES UNDER THESE CONDITIONS ARE STEEP COASTAL BLUFFS AND
OTHER STEEP HILLSIDES.</description>
